## 🛠️ How It Works

- Choose a team and season from the dropdowns.
- The app scrapes `TeamsNameUnderstats.txt`.
- Team and league options are loaded from `teams_leagues.xlsx`.
- Visuals and data insights are displayed in real-time using Streamlit.

## 📝 Customization Tips

- **Add more teams or leagues**:  
  Simply edit the `teams_leagues.xlsx` file — no code changes needed.

- **Optimize speed**:  
  Use `TeamsNameUnderstats.txt` to avoid needing to insert new teams in `teams_leagues.xlsx` .
